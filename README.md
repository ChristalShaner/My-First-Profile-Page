# My-First-Profile-Page
This is my first HTML/CSS project on GitHub. 
As much as I do not like staring at a picture of myself, this project is sentimental to me and calming to look at as well.
It is entirely my own design.

My roots in coding are within markup languages. I adore color and shapes and making beautiful things for the world. 
This little page is a reminder to me of where I started and where I want to go with my life.
My mother is extremely influential to me. As the daughter of an immigrant, I owe my 
determination amd ambitious attitude to her.
Yes, the timeline is accurate! The formatting is not perfect; but since it is still practice, I allow it. 

This code is written in HTML5, and uses CSS for the styling elements. 
I have not purchased a web domain for it, it will remain code.
That said, this project can be saved and opened using any web browser. 

If you have any questions about the content or the code, please let me know. Thank you for reading.
